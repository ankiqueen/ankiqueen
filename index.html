  <h2>Why AnkiQueen?</h2>
  
  <p>We will remain free and open forever. All that our team asks is that you donate to the <a href="https://donate.lls.org/lls/donate">Leukemia & Lymphoma Society</a> or another cancer society as we lost someone dear to our hearts to childhood leukemia. Feel free to send us a screenshot of the donation as we'd love to track how much we've raised. Thank you. ‚ù§</p>
  
  <h2>About Our Decks</h2>
  
  <p>The AnkiQueen team utilizes the <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules">SuperMemo twenty rules for formulating knowledge</a> to create high quality cards. This significantly reduces study time by:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Increasing overall retention per high quality card</li>
    <li>Decreasing the number of cards needed to cover a topic</li>
  </ul>
